This is a Discord bot designed for playing [Shadowdark RPG](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark "Shadowdark RPG"), by The Arcane Library. It is heavily inspired by [Avrae](https://avrae.io/), a bot designed for playing D&D 5e. I had previously made an attempt to use Avrae for Shadowdark, but found that the differences in spellcasting made it very difficult. Also, I wanted to import characters directly from [Shadowdarklings](https://shadowdarklings.net). Avrae supports importing from a Google Sheet, but Shadowdark characters don't exactly fit in a 5e character sheet.
